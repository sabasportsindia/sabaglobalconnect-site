      Saba Global Connect is a trusted export-import company based in Meerut, UP, India. Founded in 2024, we specialize in the global trade of industrial waste and recyclable materials. Our mission is to transform scrap into opportunity — connecting suppliers and buyers across Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.
      <br><br>
      With a strong focus on sustainability, transparency, and timely delivery, we handle imports like plastic drums, machinery scrap, and mixed industrial waste, while exporting high-quality plastic granules, rail track scrap, and metals.
      <br><br>
      We believe in building long-term partnerships through ethical business practices and reliable service. Whether you're sourcing raw materials or offloading surplus inventory, Saba Global Connect is your gateway to smarter global trade.
